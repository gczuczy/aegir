Controller:
 - Add an override for the heration during the mashing stage - can help out
   in case there's some unexpected event, and the algorithm is not able to
   determine how to keep going
 - Restrict the forcepump/blockheat overrides to the states where they are needed
 - Implement the Settings on the UI
 - Improve the temphistory fetching, it takes a long time now
 - During ForcePump, set the temperature what to keep, like during maintenance
 - Fix hopping display on the UI, currently it shows negative hops for past ones
 - Add option for "eco" tempkeeping during maintenance
